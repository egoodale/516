Limitations:
1. This is part of a larger project so it is lacking a user-friendly interface.  It is also lacking the audio files that will accompany the project.
2. The code is very senstive to inputs and will end in some places if alternate text is entered.  Please follow the instructions carefully, paying attention to things such as capitalization.
3. There is no way to go back to previous alerts without starting over.  I tried using while loops, for loops, and fuctions to at least allow the user to view the data without repeating the data entry portion but was unsuccessful.
   To make data retrival easier, I copied the file, deactivated the data entry portion of the code with //, and labeled the file "finalprojectdataretrieval".
4. There is no overwrite protection, so if the same ID code is used twice the first set of data will be replaced by the second.
5. Data retrieval is also sensitive and will not recover what is requested if the ID codes are not reentered exactly as they were the first time.

Instructions:
Data Entry:
When you open the program, an alert will appear asking for an ID code.
You may enter anything other than "Closing Message" (see limitation #4) but be sure to remember what you entered! (See limitation #5)
Next, an alert will appear asking for a question number.  Enter "1"
Three alerts will appear, one after the other, asking you to enter text.  You may enter whatever you want for each one.
Another alert will appear, this one asking for a question number.  Enter "2"
Again, Three alerts will appear, one after the other, asking you to enter text.  
As before, you may enter whatever you want for each one, but I would recommend something different than for question 1.

Data Retrieval:
An alert will appear asking if you would like to see your text.  Enter "yes"
An alert will request your ID.  Enter the ID you chose earlier.
Next, an alert will appear asking for a question number.  Enter "1"
Three alerts will appear, one after the other, these showing the text you entered.

Data Retrieval Part 2:
If you wish to see a message I have left for you, go to the file labeled "finalprojectdataretrieval".
This is purely to avoid repeating the data entry portion. (See limitation #3)
An alert will appear asking if you would like to see your text.  Enter "yes"
Enter the ID "Closing Message" and then for the question enter "1" to see my message.
Refresh, enter the ID "Closing Message" and then for the question enter "2" to see another message.
